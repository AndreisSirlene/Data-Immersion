## Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction


This dataset combines gene expression and cell viability data. 
It is based on a new technology that measures simultaneously (within the same samples) human cellsâ€™ responses to drugs in 
a pool of 100 different cell types (thus solving the problem of identifying ex-ante, which cell types are better suited for a given drug). 
In addition, shows the MoA annotations for more than 5,000 drugs.


The dataset is compost of embrionary cells experiments, each line represent one experiment id, submitted to a type of treatment, 
a specific time of observation, the number of dosage, a drug exposure or not, and consequences of the experiments.
